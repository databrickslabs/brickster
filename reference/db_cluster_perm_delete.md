# Permanently Delete a Cluster

Permanently Delete a Cluster

## Usage

``` r
db_cluster_perm_delete(
  cluster_id,
  host = db_host(),
  token = db_token(),
  perform_request = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- cluster_id:

  Canonical identifier for the cluster.

- host:

  Databricks workspace URL, defaults to calling
  [`db_host()`](https://databrickslabs.github.io/brickster/reference/db_host.md).

- token:

  Databricks workspace token, defaults to calling
  [`db_token()`](https://databrickslabs.github.io/brickster/reference/db_token.md).

- perform_request:

  If `TRUE` (default) the request is performed, if `FALSE` the httr2
  request is returned *without* being performed.

## Details

If the cluster is running, it is terminated and its resources are
asynchronously removed. If the cluster is terminated, then it is
immediately removed.

You cannot perform \*any action, including retrieve the cluster’s
permissions, on a permanently deleted cluster. A permanently deleted
cluster is also no longer returned in the cluster list.
